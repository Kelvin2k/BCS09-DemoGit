command line initialize local repository
- git init

command push file that has changes to staging area 
- git add (file name)
- git add . (push all file instantly)

check all file that are in the staging area
-git status

command create a commit (historical version)
- git commit -m "content of messages"


connect local repository to remote repository
- git remote add origin https link (https://github.com/Kelvin2k/BCS09-DemoGit.git)

first time push
push -u origin main

first time pushing code on github command
- git push -u origin (branch, can be seen at the bottom left of VS)

pushing code on github since the second time
- git push 

3 steps to push code on github
step 1: git add . (push changes in file to staging area)
step 2: git commit -m "content of message" (create a historical version of our code)
step 3: run 1 in 2 git commands: git push -u origin + branch name (if this is the first time pushing code to the remote repo github) or git push (if has already pushed the code to repo once)

when doing the project, when you open project to code, remember to pull the code from main with command: git pull origin main
then you resolve conflict if there has some
then you commit -m "handle conflict"
then you push
then you can start working now

Dealing with branch
create then switch to that branch
code sth then git add and commit-m then git push for the first time: git push -u origin (branch name)
